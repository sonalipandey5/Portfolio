<h1><center style="font-size: 50px;color: #4d0000"><b><i>Novels I Love</i></b></center></h1>
<p style="font-size: 25px;color: white;"><b> I'm very dreamy and quite creative I guess (when I was in fifth grade, I wrote a story about a woman who gave birth to an alien - who glided like a flying squirrel - because a mad scientist had made her drink a special potion being been thought of as her doctor thanks to a home-made mask... and the midwife warned the whole city with a megaphone that the alien was going to call some reinforcement to invade the city.</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;color: white;"><b>I'm easily amazed and moved (especially when I read or watch a movie) !</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;color: white;"><b>I love reading, writing, drawing and listening to music. I'd also like very much playing the electric guitar ; I've tried to start playing acoustic guitar, but the guitar strings didn't make a good sound anymore. So I'm so happy because I just got back my dad's electric guitar, now all I need is to have the amp repaired !</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;color: white;"><b>About the reading, I like funny books, romantic ones, which take place in common life , or mystery and fantastic novels, etc... I'd say that my favorite books (all in french) are the Harry Potter saga  the Mediator saga by Meg Cabot (an autor whom I greatly admire ! It's about a girl who is able to see ghosts) and Ma vie selon moi saga by Sylvaine Jaoui (it's very fresh, funny, that's read really easily and quickly ! But I don't think it exists in english).</b></p>
