<p style="font-size:25px;color: black;padding-top: 150px"><b>There was an old owl that lived in an oak. Everyday he saw incidents happening around him. Yesterday he saw a boy helping an old man to carry a heavy basket. Today he saw a girl shouting at her mother. The more he saw the less he spoke.</b> </p>


<p style="font-size:25px;color: black"><b>As he spoke less, he heard more. He heard people talking and telling stories. He heard a woman saying that an elephant jumped over a fence. He also heard a man saying that he had never made a mistake.</b> </p>


<p style="font-size:25px;color: black"><b>The old owl had seen and heard about what happened to people. Some became better and some became worse. But the old owl had become wiser each and every day.</b> </p>
